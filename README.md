## Course Outline
- Week 1: Union-find
- Week 2: Stacks, queues, elementary sorts
- Week 3: Mergesort, quicksort
- Week 4: Priority queues (binary heap), symbol tables
- Week 5: Balanced search trees (2-3 trees, red-black trees, B-trees, kd-trees)
- Week 6: Hash tables

## Assignments
- Assignment 1: Percolation (91%)
  - *Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.*
- Assignment 2: Queues (100%)
  - *Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.*
- Assignment 3: Collinear Points (100%)
  - *Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.*
- Assignment 4: 8 Puzzle (93%)
  - *Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A\* search algorithm.*
- Assignment 5: Kd-Trees (100%)
  - *Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point).*
